# Spain Skills 2024

Training for the web development modality of the SpainSkills 2024 national championship.

This repository contains all the exercises done by me to train for the Spain Skills 2024 national championship, in which I represent the Valencian community in the web development modality.

The training is divided into the following parts:

**Database** -> Exercises of creation, insertion and query of relational databases with MySQL database manager.<br>
**Frontend** -> Development of static and dynamic web pages to practice the design and implementation of Single Page Applications using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and Angular.<br>
**Backend** -> Development and implementation of API Rest with PHP and Laravel.<br>
**Mock exam** -> Resolution of the tests of the web development modality in the last SpainSkills 2022 competition.<br>
